Welcome to my project portfolio.
I specialize in AI automation, LLM prompt engineering, multi-agent systems, and data-driven application development.

This repository contains structured overviews of my end-to-end AI systems, automation tools, and application builds.
(Some private logic and proprietary components are intentionally omitted.)

Featured Projects
1. Multimodal Stock Market Prediction System (Thesis)

A research-grade ML pipeline combining:
